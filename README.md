80c51 Construção de Placa PCB.

This project consist on an amount of simulations about the micrcontroller 80c51 with the differents peripherals.
Some simulations are make in assembler language and others make in C. These simulations, together the report , can be served to instruct
someone to learned the 80c51 microcontroller and proteus software simulations, make fluxograms on inkscape programs and write in latex language.

The simulations and hardware to do these simulations are presented, and , the report is base on an article that says that proteus 
is an excellet tool to teatcher microcontroller.

Here is considered some simulations and schematic. These are:

RS232 and buttons.
AD DA.
Liquid Crystal Display.
Stepper motor.
Seven segments display (need corrections)!!!
Thermometer.
And others...
